Toca Boca Bird Salon~~~~  	(´｡• ω •｡`)

I will be implementing a game like Toca Boca Hair Salon, but for birds. This project will function more like a coloring book or
a dress-up game. The program takes the coordinates of user clicks to select from various options, which are all
stored as arrays. Most of the graphics will be implemented by drawing .png files using StdDraw. This game will not take command line arguments.
